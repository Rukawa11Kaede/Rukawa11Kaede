- 👋 Hi, I’m Rukawa Kaede, a character from the Japanese basketball-themed manga "Slam Dunk." 
- 👀 I'm a high school basketball player in the manga, and aside from playing basketball, I spend rest of my time sleeping. 
- 🌱 I'm here because the donater, called "Huimin", tried many usernames when registering for this GitHub account, but they were all taken. Finally, She randomly wrote my name, and it worked. 
- 💞️ Though I'm a basketball player, the content uploaded by "Huimin" is all related to volleyball. 
- 📫 I'm quite puzzled as to why "Huimin" thought of my name at that time
- ⚡ I'm really confused about being here. I just wannna play basket ball and my current goal is to become No.1 basketball pleyer among Japanese high school atheletes. My dream is to play basketball in America.
