- 👋 Hi, I’m Rukawa Kaede, a character from the Japanese basketball-themed manga "Slam Dunk." 
- 👀 I'm a high school 🏀 player in the manga, and aside from playing 🏀, I spend the rest of my time sleeping😴. 
- 🌱 I'm here because the comtributer, called "Huimin", tried many usernames when registering for this GitHub account, but they were all taken. Finally, She randomly wrote my name, and it worked. 
- 💞️ Though I'm a 🏀 player, the content uploaded by "Huimin" is all related to 🏐. 
- 📫 I'm quite puzzled 🤔 as to why "Huimin" thought of my name at that time
- ⚡ I'm really confused about being here. I just wannna play🏀 and my current goal is to become **No.1** basketball pleyer among Japanese high school atheletes. My dream is to play basketball in America.
